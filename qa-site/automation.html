                <p>What is automated QA? QA is a subset of the software development life cycle (SDLC), and QA automation
                    means using automated testing tools to run tests on the software being developed and report on the
                    results. Automation testing handles many of the time-consuming tasks that were previously carried
                    out by manual testers. It’s especially useful for continuous integration and continuous delivery,
                    where software is developed, tested, and deployed multiple times per day, rather than in stages.
                    Difference between manual and automated QA testing Automated QA testing relies entirely on
                    specialized tools to execute test cases and generate results, whereas manual testers follow a
                    written test plan and report the defects to developers. The two methods can be used concurrently,
                    but each is best used in a specific area. Manual testing is ideal for assessing the user experience
                    (UX), and the look and feel of an application—which can only be done by a human. It’s most often
                    used for newly-designed test cases, and on an ad-hoc basis for test cases with changeable
                    requirements. Automated testing runs on frameworks created by testers. It’s suitable for large-scale
                    software testing, and is generally more accurate than manual testing. The major benefit is that it
                    saves time, especially in regression testing which can become tedious for manual testers. The manual
                    testing process cannot be recorded, but automation test scripts are reusable—so automated QA is a
                    boon for repeated execution testing and successive development cycles. Automated tests can be run
                    24/7 without the need for manual input, although manual testing procedures can be used to
                    cross-check results. How does QA automated testing work? There are a number of important stages in
                    the automated QA testing process, which typically runs in parallel with the software development
                    life cycle. 1. Define the scope First, consider what the testing process aims to achieve, and run a
                    feasibility analysis. Which of the tests can be automated and which require manual involvement?
                    You’ll also need to factor in aspects like budget, personnel, and expertise. 2. Choose an automation
                    tool Obviously, you need a tool that fits your requirements, but the choice will also depend on the
                    technology of the web app you’re testing. There are plenty of automation tools to choose from, so
                    consider cost, functionality, intuitiveness, and flexibility. Make sure the QA team receives
                    guidance on how to get the best out of the chosen tool. 3. Design a strategy The QA team should
                    create a test plan that sets out the approach and end-goal of the project, and choose a suitable
                    framework for the test cases to operate in. The framework should contain common practices, testing
                    tools, and standards. Common test automation frameworks include data-driven, keyword-driven, linear
                    scripting, and modular testing. 4. Set the environment It’s necessary to create the right
                    environment for testing, and maximize test coverage across multiple scenarios. The test team will
                    schedule and track environment setup activities such as installing software and hardware, and
                    developing test bed scripts. This process can be time-consuming, so consider employing a company
                    like Global App Testing to help. 5. Write a script At this stage, QA engineers will write scripts to
                    perform the tests, based on actual requirements and scripting standards. Scripts should be reusable,
                    structured, and easy for a third person to understand. Open-source tools such as Selenium WebDriver,
                    Appium, and Android Monitor allow you to create your own automated test scripts, and test web
                    applications across multiple browsers in various programming languages like Java and Python. 6.
                    Execute the tests There are two main ways to automate QA testing: GUI (graphical user interface)
                    testing and API testing. GUI is a type of QA testing that aims to imitate the user experience with
                    software such as TestComplete. It can be run the same way each time, or test different software
                    features in each iteration. API testing is used to test the application programming interface. It is
                    used to assess in-house and third-party APIs, with a focus on assessing end-to-end transactions and
                    individual components. In the next section, we’ll look at some of the different types of software
                    tests. 7. Analyze and report Once the tests have been executed, the automated tool will generate a
                    report. The results will show which components contain bugs or defects, and whether or not
                    additional testing is required.</p>
