                <p class="p1">What is quality control (QA)? Quality control is a part of an organization's quality management plan
                    that prevents defects, recognizes defects during product development, and is proactive. What is
                    quality control (QC)? Quality control is also part of an organization's quality management plan that
                    focuses on detecting defects. It ensures that the final product meets all quality and safety
                    standards, and is a reactive process and is completed after quality assurance. Similarities between
                    QA and QC Aside from the differences they both share, which we'll talk about in detail later, QA and
                    QC also have some similarities. Ensuring a high-quality product: Quality assurance and quality
                    control are related and essential to quality management. Both share the same goal of identifying and
                    eliminating defects, and play a crucial role in ensuring customer satisfaction by delivering a
                    high-quality product. Following SOPs: Quality Assurance and Quality Control follow standard policies
                    and procedures established by organizations to ensure and ensure product quality. Significantly
                    reduce problems and costs By detecting and eliminating defects at an early stage, the cost of
                    resolving them later can be reduced. As the products get closer to their delivery stage and after
                    they are delivered to the customers, any defect would cost a considerable amount. QA and QC aim to
                    detect and fix problems before giving them a chance to grow. Improving development and testing
                    processes: Both provide opportunities for organizations to continually learn and become more
                    effective and efficient in delivering high-quality products. They help teams improve in areas like
                    defect identification, requirements gathering, user experience, etc. Key Differences between QA and
                    QC Nature of quality control and quality control Quality control is proactive in nature. It requires
                    measuring processes to reduce the number of defects. Its objective is to prevent defects or errors
                    before they occur during the manufacture of the product. At the same time, Quality Control is
                    reactive. It requires testing the product before releasing it to make sure it meets all standard
                    quality and safety criteria. Quality control is performed after the quality assurance processes are
                    completed. QA is a preventative process while QC is a corrective measure. QA and QC guidance Quality
                    assurance is process oriented; however, quality control is product oriented. QA focuses on taking
                    actions to create a good quality product, and QC focuses on resulting in a quality assured product.
                    Creation (QA) vs. Verification (QC) Quality control involves activities to create high-quality
                    products and define standards for product design, development, distribution, marketing, and sales.
                    Quality control consists of verifying a product before delivering it to customers to guarantee the
                    satisfaction of our customers. The whole team (QA) vs. Dedicated team (QC) The entire team is
                    responsible for quality control activities. Everyone involved in the life cycle of a product must
                    follow the SOPs for quality control. The quality control activities that the team must follow are
                    training, documentation, and review of the entire workforce. A dedicated test team is usually
                    responsible for following the SOP quality control procedure.</p>
