                <p>Essentially, the QC process can be divided into six key stages: analysis, choice of test strategy,
                    planning, test design, execution and reporting. Depending on the specific software testing
                    methodology (e.g. Agile, waterfall, V-model), these stages may be different. Requirements analysis
                    The first step begins with an analysis of the requirements as to the software product. At this
                    stage, software testers define (and understand) user expectations for a system being developed or
                    modified. This helps the team deliver the desired result and avoid any subsequent fixes. Without a
                    correct road map, even the optimal technology stack, perfect code, or comprehensive testing will
                    prove useless since the final software will not meet the needs of whomever it is intended for. And
                    to be helpful, requirements should be measurable and clear. For this purpose, they have to get
                    written in a well understandable document, which is drawn up after long discussions with the team or
                    product owner. Test Strategy As an outcome of the requirement analysis stage, a test strategy is
                    derived. The Test Strategy establishes standards for testing processes and activities. Some
                    companies include the Test Strategy in the Test Plan, which is acceptable and common for smaller
                    projects. Larger projects, on the other hand, have one Test Strategy document and a different number
                    of Test Plans for each phase or level of testing. Test Planning A test plan is a dynamic document
                    that is updated on an on-demand basis. It is essentially a blueprint for how the testing activity
                    will be performed. According to ISTQB, “Test Plan is a document describing the scope, approach,
                    resources, and schedule of intended test activities.” The testing activity will be successful if the
                    plan is detailed and comprehensive. The test plan is created by the Test Lead or test manager, and
                    it describes what to test, what not to test, how to test, when to test, and who will perform each of
                    the tests. The test plan also contains the environment and tools that will be required, resource
                    allocation, test techniques that the testers must follow, risks, and a contingency plan. According
                    to IEEE recommendations, a standard test plan content includes, among others, test items, software
                    risk issues, features to be tested, features not to be tested, the approach, item pass/fail criteria
                    (or) acceptance criteria, test deliverables, test tasks and the schedule. Test Design After
                    preparing the test plan, the software testing team will be faced with the challenge that there are
                    an infinite number of different tests that they could run, but there is not enough time to run all
                    of them. Therefore, the testers should select a subset of tests. They must be small enough to
                    execute and comprehensive at the same time to ensure that bugs are identified. For this purpose, it
                    is necessary to write specific test conditions and test cases on the basis of test objectives
                    defined during the test planning. This process is called “test design.” According to the ISTQB
                    Glossary, test condition is an item or event of a component or system that could be verified by one
                    or more test cases, e.g., a function, transaction, feature, quality attribute, or structural
                    element. Let’s say QC engineers need to test a new email application. In this case, one of test
                    conditions could be the login functionality. A test case describes the steps necessary to test any
                    functionality or module, as well as the expected and actual results. For example, check results on
                    entering invalid username and password in the email application being tested. Test Execution After
                    the test design has been prepared, it’s time to execute it. During this phase, manual testers run
                    the test cases that were created during the planning while test automation engineers use a selected
                    framework (e.g., Selenium) to execute automated test scripts and generate test reports. If the
                    actual and expected results of the test case execution differ, the test engineer opens the bug (i.e.
                    defect) in the bug tracking system (e.g. Jira, Bugzilla) so that it could be fixed by the developer.
                    After fixing, the defect goes back for testing where the tester checks it again. If the tester finds
                    that it hasn’t been fixed they will reopen it. This cycle can go until the tester is satisfied that
                    the bug has been resolved. To increase the efficiency of quality control services, the QC team needs
                    to decide which types of testing should be done manually and which should be done automatically. By
                    dividing testing activities into manual and automated tests, testers can reduce the time and effort
                    required to complete each task.</p>
