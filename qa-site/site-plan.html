      What is quality control (QA)?

      Quality control is a part of an organization's quality management plan that prevents defects, recognizes defects
      during product development, and is proactive.

      What is quality control (QC)?

      Quality control is also part of an organization's quality management plan that focuses on detecting defects. It
      ensures that the final product meets all quality and safety standards, and is a reactive process and is completed
      after quality assurance.

      Similarities between QA and QC

      Aside from the differences they both share, which we'll talk about in detail later, QA and QC also have some
      similarities.

      Ensuring a high-quality product: Quality assurance and quality control are related and essential to quality
      management. Both share the same goal of identifying and eliminating defects, and play a crucial role in ensuring
      customer satisfaction by delivering a high-quality product.

      Following SOPs: Quality Assurance and Quality Control follow standard policies and procedures established by
      organizations to ensure and ensure product quality.

      Significantly reduce problems and costs By detecting and eliminating defects at an early stage, the cost of
      resolving them later can be reduced. As the products get closer to their delivery stage and after they are
      delivered to the customers, any defect would cost a considerable amount. QA and QC aim to detect and fix problems
      before giving them a chance to grow.
      Improving development and testing processes: Both provide opportunities for organizations to continually learn and
      become more effective and efficient in delivering high-quality products. They help teams improve in areas like
      defect identification, requirements gathering, user experience, etc.
      Key Differences between QA and QC
      Nature of quality control and quality control

      Quality control is proactive in nature. It requires measuring processes to reduce the number of defects. Its
      objective is to prevent defects or errors before they occur during the manufacture of the product. At the same
      time, Quality Control is reactive. It requires testing the product before releasing it to make sure it meets all
      standard quality and safety criteria. Quality control is performed after the quality assurance processes are
      completed. QA is a preventative process while QC is a corrective measure.

      QA and QC guidance

      Quality assurance is process oriented; however, quality control is product oriented. QA focuses on taking actions
      to create a good quality product, and QC focuses on resulting in a quality assured product.

      Creation (QA) vs. Verification (QC)

      Quality control involves activities to create high-quality products and define standards for product design,
      development, distribution, marketing, and sales. Quality control consists of verifying a product before delivering
      it to customers to guarantee the satisfaction of our customers.

      The whole team (QA) vs. Dedicated team (QC)

      The entire team is responsible for quality control activities. Everyone involved in the life cycle of a product
      must follow the SOPs for quality control. The quality control activities that the team must follow are training,
      documentation, and review of the entire workforce. A dedicated test team is usually responsible for following the
      SOP quality control procedure.

    </ul>
    <h3>QC Stages</h3>
    <p>
      Essentially, the QC process can be divided into six key stages: analysis, choice of test strategy, planning, test
      design, execution and reporting. Depending on the specific software testing methodology (e.g. Agile, waterfall,
      V-model), these stages may be different.

      Requirements analysis
      The first step begins with an analysis of the requirements as to the software product. At this stage, software
      testers define (and understand) user expectations for a system being developed or modified.

      This helps the team deliver the desired result and avoid any subsequent fixes. Without a correct road map, even
      the optimal technology stack, perfect code, or comprehensive testing will prove useless since the final software
      will not meet the needs of whomever it is intended for.

      And to be helpful, requirements should be measurable and clear. For this purpose, they have to get written in a
      well understandable document, which is drawn up after long discussions with the team or product owner.

      Test Strategy
      As an outcome of the requirement analysis stage, a test strategy is derived. The Test Strategy establishes
      standards for testing processes and activities.
      Some companies include the Test Strategy in the Test Plan, which is acceptable and common for smaller projects.
      Larger projects, on the other hand, have one Test Strategy document and a different number of Test Plans for each
      phase or level of testing.

      Test Planning
      A test plan is a dynamic document that is updated on an on-demand basis. It is essentially a blueprint for how the
      testing activity will be performed.

      According to ISTQB, “Test Plan is a document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended
      test activities.” The testing activity will be successful if the plan is detailed and comprehensive.

      The test plan is created by the Test Lead or test manager, and it describes what to test, what not to test, how to
      test, when to test, and who will perform each of the tests. The test plan also contains the environment and tools
      that will be required, resource allocation, test techniques that the testers must follow, risks, and a contingency
      plan.

      According to IEEE recommendations, a standard test plan content includes, among others, test items, software risk
      issues, features to be tested, features not to be tested, the approach, item pass/fail criteria (or) acceptance
      criteria, test deliverables, test tasks and the schedule.

      Test Design
      After preparing the test plan, the software testing team will be faced with the challenge that there are an
      infinite number of different tests that they could run, but there is not enough time to run all of them.
      Therefore, the testers should select a subset of tests. They must be small enough to execute and comprehensive at
      the same time to ensure that bugs are identified.

      For this purpose, it is necessary to write specific test conditions and test cases on the basis of test objectives
      defined during the test planning. This process is called “test design.”

      According to the ISTQB Glossary, test condition is an item or event of a component or system that could be
      verified by one or more test cases, e.g., a function, transaction, feature, quality attribute, or structural
      element.

      Let’s say QC engineers need to test a new email application. In this case, one of test conditions could be the
      login functionality.

      A test case describes the steps necessary to test any functionality or module, as well as the expected and actual
      results. For example, check results on entering invalid username and password in the email application being
      tested.

      Test Execution
      After the test design has been prepared, it’s time to execute it. During this phase, manual testers run the test
      cases that were created during the planning while test automation engineers use a selected framework (e.g.,
      Selenium) to execute automated test scripts and generate test reports.

      If the actual and expected results of the test case execution differ, the test engineer opens the bug (i.e.
      defect) in the bug tracking system (e.g. Jira, Bugzilla) so that it could be fixed by the developer.

      After fixing, the defect goes back for testing where the tester checks it again. If the tester finds that it
      hasn’t been fixed they will reopen it. This cycle can go until the tester is satisfied that the bug has been
      resolved.
      To increase the efficiency of quality control services, the QC team needs to decide which types of testing should
      be done manually and which should be done automatically. By dividing testing activities into manual and automated
      tests, testers can reduce the time and effort required to complete each task.

    <h3>Automation</h3>
    <p>
      What is automated QA?
      QA is a subset of the software development life cycle (SDLC), and QA automation means using automated testing
      tools to run tests on the software being developed and report on the results.

      Automation testing handles many of the time-consuming tasks that were previously carried out by manual testers.
      It’s especially useful for continuous integration and continuous delivery, where software is developed, tested,
      and deployed multiple times per day, rather than in stages.
      Difference between manual and automated QA testing
      Automated QA testing relies entirely on specialized tools to execute test cases and generate results, whereas
      manual testers follow a written test plan and report the defects to developers. The two methods can be used
      concurrently, but each is best used in a specific area.

      Manual testing is ideal for assessing the user experience (UX), and the look and feel of an application—which can
      only be done by a human. It’s most often used for newly-designed test cases, and on an ad-hoc basis for test cases
      with changeable requirements.

      Automated testing runs on frameworks created by testers. It’s suitable for large-scale software testing, and is
      generally more accurate than manual testing. The major benefit is that it saves time, especially in regression
      testing which can become tedious for manual testers.

      The manual testing process cannot be recorded, but automation test scripts are reusable—so automated QA is a boon
      for repeated execution testing and successive development cycles. Automated tests can be run 24/7 without the need
      for manual input, although manual testing procedures can be used to cross-check results.

      How does QA automated testing work?
      There are a number of important stages in the automated QA testing process, which typically runs in parallel with
      the software development life cycle.

      1. Define the scope
      First, consider what the testing process aims to achieve, and run a feasibility analysis. Which of the tests can
      be automated and which require manual involvement? You’ll also need to factor in aspects like budget, personnel,
      and expertise.

      2. Choose an automation tool
      Obviously, you need a tool that fits your requirements, but the choice will also depend on the technology of the
      web app you’re testing. There are plenty of automation tools to choose from, so consider cost, functionality,
      intuitiveness, and flexibility. Make sure the QA team receives guidance on how to get the best out of the chosen
      tool.

      3. Design a strategy
      The QA team should create a test plan that sets out the approach and end-goal of the project, and choose a
      suitable framework for the test cases to operate in. The framework should contain common practices, testing tools,
      and standards. Common test automation frameworks include data-driven, keyword-driven, linear scripting, and
      modular testing.

      4. Set the environment
      It’s necessary to create the right environment for testing, and maximize test coverage across multiple scenarios.
      The test team will schedule and track environment setup activities such as installing software and hardware, and
      developing test bed scripts. This process can be time-consuming, so consider employing a company like Global App
      Testing to help.

      5. Write a script
      At this stage, QA engineers will write scripts to perform the tests, based on actual requirements and scripting
      standards. Scripts should be reusable, structured, and easy for a third person to understand.

      Open-source tools such as Selenium WebDriver, Appium, and Android Monitor allow you to create your own automated
      test scripts, and test web applications across multiple browsers in various programming languages like Java and
      Python.

      6. Execute the tests
      There are two main ways to automate QA testing: GUI (graphical user interface) testing and API testing. GUI is a
      type of QA testing that aims to imitate the user experience with software such as TestComplete. It can be run the
      same way each time, or test different software features in each iteration.

      API testing is used to test the application programming interface. It is used to assess in-house and third-party
      APIs, with a focus on assessing end-to-end transactions and individual components.

      In the next section, we’ll look at some of the different types of software tests.

      7. Analyze and report
      Once the tests have been executed, the automated tool will generate a report. The results will show which
      components contain bugs or defects, and whether or not additional testing is required.
