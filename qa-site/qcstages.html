                <h1>QC STAGES</h1>
                <img class="qcs1" src="images/qc1.jpg" alt="qc">
                <p>Essentially, the QC process can be divided into six key stages: analysis, choice of test strategy,
                    planning, test design, execution and reporting. Depending on the specific software testing
                    methodology (e.g. Agile, waterfall, V-model), these stages may be different. Requirements analysis
                    The first step begins with an analysis of the requirements as to the software product. At this
                    stage, software testers define (and understand) user expectations for a system being developed or
                    modified. This helps the team deliver the desired result and avoid any subsequent fixes. Without a
                    correct road map, even the optimal technology stack, perfect code, or comprehensive testing will
                    prove useless since the final software will not meet the needs of whomever it is intended for. And
                    to be helpful, requirements should be measurable and clear. For this purpose, they have to get
                    written in a well understandable document, which is drawn up after long discussions with the team or
                    product owner. Test Strategy As an outcome of the requirement analysis stage, a test strategy is
                    derived. The Test Strategy establishes standards for testing processes and activities. Some
                    companies include the Test Strategy in the Test Plan, which is acceptable and common for smaller
                    projects. Larger projects, on the other hand, have one Test Strategy document and a different number
                    of Test Plans for each phase or level of testing. Test Planning A test plan is a dynamic document
                    that is updated on an on-demand basis. It is essentially a blueprint for how the testing activity
                    will be performed. .</p>

                <p> Step1: Problem Definition / Problem justification – Emergency response
                    1.1 Brief Description of Problem:
                    It should include details of 5W-2H; present level and target

                    What…happened?
                    Where…did it happen?
                    When…did it happen?
                    Who…is complaining?
                    Why…is ‘who’ complaining?
                    How…was it discovered?
                    How big…from the problem?
                    problem define
                    Here you need to specify the Current level based on the average data for the last 4 to 6 months.

                    1.2 Justification Use Trend graph or Pareto, Occurrence and/or severity as applicable
                    In this section, you will explain why we are working on this problem. And we have here the complete
                    justification that for the purpose of solving this problem we will work to resolve the same.

                    We need to show how we know this is a problem.

                    1.3 Emergency Response:
                    If immediate protection of the customer is required, then this step can be included. Otherwise, it
                    can be ignored. It can include containment action and immediate action to all over the operations
                    and supply chain.

                    On successful implementation of step 4, this action should be removed.

                    Step 2: Observation of process – Understand the current situation
                    observation - qc story
                    2.1 Observation of process
                    Prepare/use process flow diagram if required

                    Perform process walkthrough to verify if there is any non-adherence to standard practice,
                    Specification/ SOP/ Control plan, etc.

                    2.2 Understand the current situation
                    Understand the situation based on Time-to-time, person-to-person, stream-to-stream,
                    location-to-location, changes as applicable in the study.

                    Use of Sketches, photos, stratification, run chart, concentration diagram, histogram, control chart,
                    etc as applicable

                    graphs
                    Here is where we explained the status of the issue before we started working to improve it.

                    Step 3: Analysis: Possible causes, probable causes – Testing of hypothesis and root causes
                    3.1 Identify the possible & probable causes
                    Use Cause & Effect diagram to identify possible causes

                    cause and effect diagram
                    Cause & Effect Diagram
                    Use Experience, Engineering Judgment, Practical check on possible causes and eliminate invalid
                    causes and arrive at the probable cause

                    3.2 Confirm the probable causes
                    Carry out Test of Hypothesis on Probable causes:

                    Apply Test of hypothesis based on the factual data. Decide validation of cause logically. You can
                    use

                    Good and bad product comparison
                    Statistical comparative tools
                    Change analysis on product or process since product/process launch
                    Any other appropriate data-based tool

                    3.3 Identify the root causes
                    List the validated causes based on the above step using the root cause analysis.

                    Step 4: Actions
                    Carry out why-why analysis on valid causes & identify actions. Consider various probable actions.

                    Assign each corrective action a priority and stick to it. Involve the operators.

                    The use of color, limits, graphics, and instructions at the place where the corrective measure is to
                    be applied are effective means of drawing attention to it.

                    Share the results with all interested parties!

                    Consider effectiveness expected, cost, ease of implementation, productivity, etc. to prioritize the
                    solution

                    Step 5: Check
                    5.1 Verify the results
                    Represent the data in the same way as in step 1.2
                    Check the result in comparison with If expected result.
                    If the expected result is not achieved seek an alternate action plan.
                    check - qc story
                    5.2 Carry out full-scale implementation :
                    Include appropriate data and graph to verify the results as mentioned in the justification (before &
                    after etc)

                    5.3 Quantify Tangible benefits
                    a) return on investment b) annualized savings

                    If the effects can be convert into gains (financial), this is preferable e.g. Return on investment,
                    annualized savings

                    As far as possible, the effect of each action on the final result must be shown (by numbering them).

                    Step 6: Standardization
                    6.1 Updating of documents
                    Update all the relevant documents like Drawings/specifications, PFD, PFMEA, Control Plan, SOP,
                    Checklist, etc. & mention the reference of the same.

                    6.2 Training
                    If the problem stems from the operating procedure, train the operator on the new standard

                    Train people on new/modified SOP

                    Train people to modify/develop SOS

                    training - standardization in qc story
                    6.3Additional audit or check
                    Check the quality level and how the operator functions with the new method/procedure for at least
                    two weeks.

                    Carry out additional audits/checks to ensure adherence to the new

                    system & monitoring results achieved

                    we explain the steps that were to ensure that the implemented solution remains effective. We want to
                    prevent the process from reverting to its previous so we can continue to hold the gains achieved by
                    the process improvement.

                    Step 7: Conclusion
                    conclusion - 7 step QC story
                    Finally, once we take all necessary actions and solve the problem, all results with progress are
                    report to management. And an action plan is drawn for the causes that cannot be resolved now.</p>
